Marianne API - Marianne
What is the method of authentication they use
	Similar to OAuth signing, this method of authentication certifies that a request was approved by a particular user. 
	Unlike OAuth-signed requests, key-signed requests may be reused and recycled as long as their corresponding API key 
	is valid. If a signed URL is released to the public, any application can use it to interact with Meetup as if it had
	that API key; the difference is that it can not change definitive parameters or use the signature against other API methods.
	Because requests are signed with an API key as well as a Meetup private key, it is not possible for applications to
	sign them independently. Instead they pass a "sign=true" parameter along with a standard read request authorized by 
	an API key. This causes a "signed_url" field to be returned in the response metadata. OAuth requests may not be signed 
	with an API key, as this would allow a consumer to continue act on behalf of a user even if its access token is revoked.
